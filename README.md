* Gather list of meteorite landings with their latitudes and longitudes
* Clean the dataset to drop any rows with null Lat or Lon values, and all other columns be filled with NA where there are null values
* Merge both of the cleaned lists in Postgres off of the Lat and Lon's of each list
* Query different questions to gather results on the data within Postgres
